If plain water doesn't cut it, try drinking flavored sparkling water or brewing a cup of fruit-infused herbal tea.</div>

                            <strong>Eat several mini-meals during the day.</strong> <br> If you eat fewer calories than you burn, you'll lose weight. But when you're hungry all the time, eating fewer calories can be a challenge. "Studies show people who eat 4-5 meals or snacks per day are better able to control their appetite and weight," says obesity researcher Rebecca Reeves, DrPH, RD. She recommends dividing your daily calories into smaller meals or snacks and enjoying most of them earlier in the day -- dinner should be the last time you eat.

Good fiber sources include oatmeal, beans, whole grain foods, nuts, and most fruits and vegetables.

You know how it goes -- "out of sight, out of mind."

For one thing, feeling like you should do something makes it seem like work, or an obligation. That's no fun! You're also thinking about what will happen if you don't exercise -- in other words, you're threatening yourself with punishment (the image of being unfit). Subconsciously, you're flooding your mind with negativity. Instead of thinking about how you'll look if you don't work out, think about how great you'd look if you did!
It's very important to think in the positive. Instead of, "God, I feel terrible for not working out," think "I'd feel better if I worked out -- so tomorrow I will." If you think in "nots" and "nevers" and "didn'ts," you're just bogging yourself down, making it even harder to get motivated!

Sign up for a charity walk or run that will encourage you to train. Once you have a set date to work towards, you'll have a goal in mind while you're working out. The feeling of accomplishment after you're done will encourage you to sign up for another or to just continue being fit.</div>

Make a reward for every session, every week, every pound, or every task you do/exercise/lose/complete -- whichever speaks to you. This is all about training your brain. When you see the good stuff behind all the work, it'll give you the strength to keep going and to stick with it.
The other side of the coin is to make the alternatives worse. Tell yourself if you don't work out, you have to organize the attic, or call that cousin you haven't spoken to since that awkward family reunion. Now that's one threatening motivation.

If you eat healthily, you'll feel healthier. When you feel healthier, guess what? You'll feel more like working out.
In addition to eating healthily, eat breakfast! Not only will it energize you for the entire day, but it'll help you maintain a healthy weight and stay strong.[1] Oh, and chug the water, too!</div>

                              Spending money and having nothing to show for it is a pretty crappy feeling. So when you spend triple digits on shoes, pants, and other gear, you gotta use it. So go out and buy a new workout outfit! Part of you will be chomping at the bit to go slink it around the gym.
However, this won't work if you leave it in a bag in your car or bury it at the back of your closet. When you buy that outfit, leave it out. Place it on your dresser, on your bed -- heck, on the kitchen counter -- to torment you until you wear it. Once again, the whole "out of sight, out of mind" thing is what you're working on here. Constant reminders will keep you on the right track!

You'll feel motivated to exercise each time the old, deprecated activity comes up in your mind, and not short on time due to the new exercise habit.
How often do we get lazy and do things that we're not particularly engaged in? All. The. Time. Everyone does. So next time you find yourself channel surfing, take it as a cue. You don't have to go to the gym, but get up and go for a walk. Clean the dishes. Organize the garage. Just do something else. You'll feel better (and more productive) after!.</div>

                              If you want to go to the gym, but just don't feel like it, just drive yourself to gym. Tell yourself that if you still don't feel like working out, you'll go home. Odds are, though, once you're there, you won't feel like driving home. Then tell yourself you'll just walk on the treadmill for 10 minutes, even if your exercise routine involves much more. Just telling yourself to do one more thing, without having to commit to anything else, will make things much easier. And before long, your endorphins will take over.
If your form of exercise involves going outside, a good first step is to get dressed and just sit outside. A good next step is to walk. You'll find that once you're dressed to go and walking, exercise doesn't seem like such a big stretch.

Reading others' success stories, apart from being heartwarming, will make you think, "Well, heck, if she can do it, so can I." And that's exactly how it works -- you see these normal people (just like the rest of us) who took on these marvelous feats and came out ahead. You're next!.</div>

Working out is such a common thing nowadays. If it's not working out, it's dieting. Nobody is happy with what they look like or their health levels it seems. Use this to your advantage! Do you have a group of coworkers, friends, or family members that are going through the same thing? Suggest you team up! You all can put yours heads together to support each other. After all, there's strength in numbers.

That includes the TV, your phone, the computer, the whole gamut of technology. When the time rolls around to work out and you're not feeling it, disconnect. Don't let yourself use these things. You may find that you're bored enough to go for that run!</div>

           <div class="panel-body"><strong>Do something small, right now</strong><br> Going all the way to the gym, or getting decked out in your jogging gear, or doing whatever it is you feel you should be doing obviously seems like too much work. So just do ten push-ups or jumping jacks. Easy. And usually, it's just enough to get your heart rate going a little bit and make you feel like a little more exercise wouldn't be so bad.
Half the battle may be that working out seems like it just takes so much damn time. Between getting ready, going, working out, showering, getting home, and getting back into your day, hours have just disappeared. But doing small things can be effective, too! Don't write 'em off just because you're not drenched in sweat.</div>

So if you hand your body and mind an equivalent workout, don't expect anything different. Do something that you enjoy, will stick to, and want to see through to the end.
This may take readjusting your concept of "working out." It's anything that gets you moving! You don't have to go pounding the pavement or asking for a spotter at the gym. Go swimming, go for a walk in the park, take a dance class -- anything. If you like it, do it. It counts!

You might be fascinated for a while and tell yourself you're gonna do it(!)...and then two Latin lessons in you decide Oprah's Book Club is more up your alley. Basically, when it comes to working out (and reading), to stay motivated, don't bite off more than you can chew. Make it doable -- make it small.
It's easy to sit on the couch on Sunday evening and say, "Okay -- I'm starting. I'm running 4 miles (6.4 km) a day every day until I shed these 20 pounds!" Yeah. About that. You might be revved up for the first few days, but then you stumble so quickly it's impossible to get back up on the horse. So start with 20 minutes a day. A mile walk. Then, up it as you go. If it's doable, guess what? You can do it. And you will.</div>

                              Your favorite author just wrote a new novel that's supposed to be really good -- but it's only available at a store across town, the hours are 1:30-2:00 on Thursdays, and there's no parking lot. Are you gonna get that book? Probably not. Same goes for your workout. If it's inconvenient, it's not gonna happen. Pick one that you can get done that doesn't cut into your day so you get 'er done (or else you'll end up resentful, too).
Pick a gym that makes sense. Even if the best one is 30 minutes away, you'll be better off going to a decent one that's on your way home from work. Alternatively, plan out a routine you can do at home (yoga, anyone?) and fix it into your schedule. When there are no two ways around it, you'll feel obligated to do it.

           <div class="panel-body">This is similar to the "make yourself accountable" step. When you have another person depending on you (for a ride, for a partner at the gym, whatever), the guilt of letting that person down forces you to do what you promised you'd do. And since you definitely know at least one person that works out, too, this is an easy resource to tap into.
Okay, so you're not close enough to anyone that you feel is "on your level?" Join a class or get a trainer. You'll have the added pressure of getting your money's worth -- many places will still charge you if you skip out.</div>

Get into interval training. If your schedule is jammed pack, this is the workout for you. If you haven't heard of it, where have you been? High intensity interval training is one of the fastest fat-blasting workouts on the planet (at least right now). You simply alternate between super intense bouts of exercise and rest.[4] The easiest example is 30 seconds full out on the treadmill followed by 20 seconds of rest, but you can do it with weights, too.

If you like the idea of sticking to a routine that requires zero weights and zero gym memberships, don't think you have to work these two in. If you're a runner, try running someplace else, running at a different time of day, or concentrating on sprints, a better time, or a better overall distance. You can change your goals, too!
